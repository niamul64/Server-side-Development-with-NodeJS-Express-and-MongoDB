The Postman tool allows you to create HTTP requests and then send them. And it also gives you the flexibility of setting up the headers for your HTTP request before you send it in. And then when the response comes back, you're able to examine the response including the headers of the response that comes back from the server side.

you can download the stand-alone Postman tool from http://getpostman.com and install it on your computer.
